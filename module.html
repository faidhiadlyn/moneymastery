        <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2%;">
      The world of investments may be incredibly dynamic and often changing. 
        On the other hand, individuals who invest the necessary time to comprehend the fundamental ideas and the various asset 
        classes stand to benefit greatly in the long run. The first stage is to become familiar with the various investment kinds and 
        the positions they hold on the risk ladder.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investing involves using your money to purchase assets that have the potential to grow in value over time, 
            generating returns or profits. These assets can range from stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, 
            to commodities like gold. <br><br>Investing is like planting a seed today to reap benefits tomorrow. For students in Malaysia, 
            understanding the basics of investing can set a strong foundation for future financial stability. 
            There are various investment options available, each with its own risks and potential returns.
          </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2%;"> 
          Given the increasing prevalence of financial literacy, it is not surprising that Malaysian students are beginning to investigate investing at an early age - as early as their teens. There is a lot of research to be done with the abundance of financial options available, including unit trusts, robo-advisors, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
          The term risk appetite is often used interchangeably with risk tolerance, but it’s important to note that these are different.
          <br><br> A unit trust is a collective investment where funds from multiple investors just like you are pooled into a huge fund, hence why unit trusts are also referred to as mutual funds.
          Fund managers then hold the tough responsibility to invest the funds appropriately in line with the fund’s objectives and garner positive returns for all investors. From a young student’s perspective, unit trusts can be particularly suitable to get you head started on your investment journey.

          <p class="slide-in from-left">
            <b>1. Stock Market</b><br>
            Investing in stocks means owning a small part of a company. For instance, in Malaysia, you have companies like 
            Maybank that offer stocks. You can buy and sell these stocks through a brokerage account. The value of stocks 
            can rise or fall based on how well the company performs.

          <p class="slide-in from-left">
            <b>2. ASNB (Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad)</b> <br>is a popular choice. It pools money from multiple investors to invest in stocks, 
            bonds, or other assets. Investors own units of the fund, and the value of these units fluctuates based on the fund's 
            performance.
           <br><br>ASNB offers various unit trust funds that allow investors to start with relatively low capital. These funds pool 
            money from investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. For example, 
            the ASB (Amanah Saham Bumiputera) fund primarily caters to Bumiputera investors, providing them with a means to invest in 
            a diversified portfolio.

            <b>3. Public Gold Malaysia</b><br>
            is an example. Gold is considered a safe-haven investment. Its value can increase during economic uncertainty. You can 
            invest in physical gold or gold-related funds. Investing in gold is a popular choice due to its stability and potential to hedge against inflation. Public Gold Malaysia offers various gold investment products, including physical gold bars and coins, making it accessible for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 125%";>Scenario</h2><br>
       <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2%;"> Let’s consider an example as below. Let's say you have <b>RM500</b> 
        to invest. You might decide to:
      </p><br>
        
        <ul style="margin-left: 15%;">
          <li><b> Allocate RM300 in ASNB</b><br> You purchase units in an ASNB fund. Over time, the value of these units may increase, giving you returns.</li><br>
          <li><b>Invest RM100 in a Stock</b><br> You pick a reputable company listed on Bursa Malaysia, maybe like Maybank. Monitor its performance and consider its future growth potential.
          </li><br>
          <li><b> Use RM100 to Buy Gold</b><br> You can buy physical gold from a reputable dealer like Public Gold Malaysia or invest in a gold fund. Gold can act as a hedge against economic uncertainty.
          </li><br>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2%;"><br> Over time, you can monitor the performance of her investments. 
          If ASB generates dividends or your gold investment appreciates, <br>you might reinvest the returns or consider diversifying further. 
          Remember, investing involves risks. It's <br> crucial to conduct thorough research or consult a financial advisor before making 
          investment decisions. <br><br>As a student, starting small and learning along the way can set a strong foundation for future financial 
          stability.
